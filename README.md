# Supermarket Sales Analysis Dashboard 🛒



## 💼 Business Problem
A supermarket chain with branches in Yangon, Mandalay, and Naypyitaw needed to understand sales trends to optimize their inventory and marketing strategies. The goal was to identify top-performing branches, customer demographics, and peak sales hours.

## 🛠️ Takeaway
I built an interactive dashboard using **Google Looker Studio** to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) from raw transactional data.

**Key Technical Features:**
* **Data Cleaning:** Standardized currency and date formats in Google Sheets.
* **Custom Metrics:** Calculated *Profit Margin* and *Average Transaction Value* using calculated fields.
* **Interactivity:** Implemented cross-filtering and dropdown controls for City, Gender, and Payment type.

## 💡 Key Insights
1. **Branch Performance:** Branch A (Yangon) is the highest revenue generator.
2. **Customer Behavior:** "Member" customers have a significantly higher Average Order Value than "Normal" customers.
3. **Sales Trends:** The busiest shopping hours are between 7 PM and 9 PM, suggesting a need for increased staff during evening shifts.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This dashboard allows store managers to make data-driven decisions on staffing and product promotion.
